                    <img src="https://picsum.photos/300/200?random=13" alt="Historic photo of The Modern Frame gallery opening" class="float-left">
                    <p>Founded in 1985 by art enthusiast Margaret Thompson, <strong>The Modern Frame</strong> began as a small space dedicated to showcasing emerging contemporary artists. What started as a humble gallery in the heart of the arts district has evolved into one of the city's most respected venues for contemporary art.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our mission has always been to bridge the gap between artists and art lovers, creating a space where innovation meets appreciation. We believe that contemporary art has the power to challenge perspectives, evoke emotions, and inspire meaningful conversations about our world.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>Over the years, we have been privileged to work with hundreds of talented artists, from local emerging talents to internationally recognized masters.</em> Our gallery has become a launching pad for many successful artistic careers and a second home for art enthusiasts from around the world.</p>

                    <img src="https://picsum.photos/280/180?random=14" alt="Gallery interior showing modern exhibition space" class="float-right">
                    <p>The gallery underwent major renovations in 2010, expanding our exhibition space and adding state-of-the-art lighting and climate control systems. These improvements allow us to display a wider variety of artworks while ensuring their preservation for future generations.</p>

                    <p>Today, The Modern Frame continues to push boundaries, embracing both traditional and digital art forms. We are committed to supporting artists at all stages of their careers and providing our community with access to thought-provoking, high-quality contemporary art.</p>
