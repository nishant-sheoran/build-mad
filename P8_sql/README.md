# SQL Operations Demonstration

A comprehensive SQL script that demonstrates all major SQL operations using Customer and Employee tables.

## üìã Overview

This project contains a complete SQL script that showcases:

- **DDL Commands** (Data Definition Language)
- **DML Commands** (Data Manipulation Language) 
- **DCL Commands** (Data Control Language)
- **TCL Commands** (Transaction Control Language)
- **JOIN Operations** (All types of joins)

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

### Customer Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    registration_date DATE,
    age INT
);
```

### Employee Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    dept VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),

    job_title VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES Employee(employee_id)
);
```

## üîó JOIN Operations

### 1. INNER JOIN
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
FROM Customer c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
FROM Customer c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### 3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
FROM Customer c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN
```sql
-- Simulated using UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
FROM Customer c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
UNION
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
FROM Customer c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id IS NULL;
```

### 5. CROSS JOIN
```sql
SELECT c.first_name as customer_name, e.first_name as employee_name
FROM Customer c
CROSS JOIN Employee e;
```

## üîÑ SET Operations

### 1. UNION
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Customer
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Customer2
ORDER BY first_name;
```

### 2. UNION ALL
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Customer
UNION ALL
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Customer2
ORDER BY first_name;
```

### 3. INTERSECT (Simulated)
```sql
-- Using INNER JOIN
SELECT DISTINCT c1.first_name, c1.last_name
FROM Customer c1
INNER JOIN Customer2 c2 ON c1.first_name = c2.first_name AND c1.last_name = c2.last_name;

-- Using IN clause
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Customer
WHERE (first_name, last_name) IN (SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Customer2);
```

### 4. MINUS/EXCEPT (Simulated)
```sql
-- Using LEFT JOIN
SELECT c1.first_name, c1.last_name
FROM Customer c1
LEFT JOIN Customer2 c2 ON c1.first_name = c2.first_name AND c1.last_name = c2.last_name
WHERE c2.first_name IS NULL;

-- Using NOT IN
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Customer
WHERE (first_name, last_name) NOT IN (SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Customer2);
```

## üìä Sample Data

- Order 1003: Mike Johnson, Dave Designer, $89.99
- Order 1004: Sarah Williams, Eve Support, $320.75
- Order 1005: John Doe, Bob Developer, $195.25

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Set up your database environment** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)

2. **Run the SQL script:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p database_name < sql_operations.sql
   ```

3. **Or copy and paste sections** into your SQL client

4. **Execute commands step by step** to see the results

## üìù Notes

- **MySQL Compatibility**: Script is written for MySQL but can be adapted for other databases
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: MySQL doesn't support FULL OUTER JOIN directly, so it's simulated using UNION
- **INTERSECT/MINUS**: These are simulated using JOINs and subqueries for MySQL compatibility
- **Transaction Safety**: Always use transactions when modifying data in production

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This script helps you understand:

1. **Database Design**: Creating tables with proper relationships
2. **Data Manipulation**: CRUD operations and data modification
3. **Data Control**: User privileges and security
4. **Transaction Management**: ACID properties and transaction control
5. **Data Retrieval**: Complex queries and joins
6. **Set Operations**: Combining and comparing datasets

## üîß Advanced Features

- **Subqueries**: Nested queries for complex data retrieval
- **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER() for ranking
- **CASE Statements**: Conditional logic in queries
- **EXISTS**: Efficient existence checking
- **Constraints**: Primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints
